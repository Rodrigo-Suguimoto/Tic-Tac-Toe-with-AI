# Tic Tac Toe with AI

I've created this game with Java as part of the [Hyperskill's curriculum](https://hyperskill.org/projects/81).
You'll be able to play against another human or AI with three difficulty modes: easy, medium and hard.

1. The easy AI will only play random moves
2. The medium AI is a little bit smarter. Although they also play some random moves, when you're about to win, he will defend and when he has a chance of winning, he will win.
3. The hard AI won't let you win. You'll only lose or draw, because it uses the minimax algorithm which is a pretty cool algorithm used in Game Development. It recursively evaluates the moves and counter-moves and selectes the best possible move.
